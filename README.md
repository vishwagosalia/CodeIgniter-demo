# MyCodeigniter

Created a simple form for hands-on practice and understand the concepts of CODEIGNITER. This project is a basic prototype on how the CI works
and how the data can be passed between model view controller.
Execution start with index.php file in views folder. And 'myfirstform' controller initiates the form and  handles the data from view to controller.
